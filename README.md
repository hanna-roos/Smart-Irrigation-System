# Smart-Irrigation-System
Smart Irrigation System using Wokwi and MIT App Inventor (IoT WorkShop)
I learned this from a workshop/summer camp during high school breaks. I should share it with people who want to learn about connecting their mobile devices to Wokwi using MIT App Inventor. I also want to point out that you should download the MIT AI2 Companion app on your phones, from there you can connect using the code from MIT App Inventor 

hope you enjoy learning and making this project
